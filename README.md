# jQuery Course Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises developed during the [jQuery course](https://www.udemy.com/course/jquery-curso-completo/) on Udemy. The projects demonstrate practical uses of jQuery for enhancing interactivity in web applications, including DOM manipulation, event handling, animations, and AJAX functionality.

3. Open the specific project folder and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
